I've always been annoyed at not being able to create an empty file in the Finder. After way too long, I've finally done something about this. You can, too.

Open Automator and create a new "Quick Action". I named mine "Create File". Then make it look like this:

To use it, select a folder in the Finder and right click and pick your action under the "Quick Action" menu.
